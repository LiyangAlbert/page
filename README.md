# A Simple Personal Webpage 

- A lightweight and visually appealing site that serves as a hub for work, projects, and interests.

- **This personal webpage is built and redesigned upon the project [iissnan.github.com](https://github.com/iissnan/iissnan.github.com).**
- `html`, `JavaScript` and `jQuery`. Engaging *animations* and *typing effects* enhance the user experience.

- Feel free to reach out to me via my [GitHub](https://github.com/liyangalbert).

- Feel free to use this project as a template for your own work, but please remember to give credit to the original source.
